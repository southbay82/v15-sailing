# V-15 Sailing

## Overview
This project supports the Vanguard 15 sailing community with articles, parts, regatta info, and more. Built with Next.js and deployed via Netlify.

---

## CI/CD and Automated Post-Deploy Testing

This project uses Netlify for static site deployment and GitHub Actions for automated testing.

### Post-Deploy Smoke Tests
- After every successful Netlify deployment, a webhook triggers a GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/post-deploy-tests.yml`).
- The workflow runs Playwright smoke tests against the live site (`https://dev.v-15.org`) to ensure key pages are up and content is correct.
- See [`doc/ci-post-deploy-webhook-setup.md`](doc/ci-post-deploy-webhook-setup.md) for setup and configuration details.

---

## Local Development
- Run tests locally with `npm test` or `make test`.
- For Playwright smoke tests: `npx playwright test tests/smoke`
