Help me create a prompt that will generate a website that is secure and simple to provide information to Vanguard 15 sailor. I have the original Vanguard 15 website to be used as a reference for how content was organized, but I want this new website to be modern sleek and simple. It's primary goal is to provide sailor with references to both informational article links recommendations for part locations and ways to source new Vanguard 15 sailboats and references to existing Vanguard 15 sailing Regatta activity around the United States and world the site should be statically served to keep it simple and secure content updates will happen in a flexible way of your choosing whether it's gets via pure source or a combination of gitops and putting content in certain statically sourced locations like an S3 bucket. Follow the rules in the project structure this prompt in XML to be best read in by an LLM if you have any other clarifying questions, please ask them prior to generate the final external structured output
