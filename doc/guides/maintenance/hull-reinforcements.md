Vanguard 15 Hull Reinforcements
The following reinforcements are sometimes made to Vanguard 15’s that have
been in use for several seasons.
The construction of V15’s has evolved in order to make the boats more durable.
Examples of this are the use of Plexus for all structural bonds in the boat, the
use of a metal backing plate and tapped fasteners for the mainsheet ratchet
eyestrap, and the addition of reinforcements in the hull stringers. Another major
change has been the shortening of the spreader length. The class rule that
shortens the spreaders to 14” from 16” decreases the rig’s ability to deliver
punishing loads to the hull, and reduces the benefit of sailing with extreme rig
tension.
As always, if you suspect that you have a warranty matter with your boat, please
contact your V15 dealer. This will allow the fastest and best resolution to all
warranty matters.
