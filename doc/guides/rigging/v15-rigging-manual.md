Rigging
Locate the daggerboard shockcord (in the line bag) and attach each
end to the eyestraps that secure the forward end of the hiking straps.
You may have to raise the line bags to locate the eyestraps. Make
sure your knot is very tight; shockcord easily unties itself.
Assembling the mast
The mast comes already rigged except for the spreaders, which are
taped to the mast. Remove all tape, and untie the halyards; secure
them loosely around the mast so they won’t be lost when stepping.
Before you install the spreaders, make sure the hoist end of the main
halyard (which comes off the aft side of the masthead sheave) is aft
of the spreader brackets and all other rigging is forward. This will
save you a lot of aggravation later on. Locate the spreaders and pull
the clevis pins out of the spreader brackets.  
Spreader installation
Slide the end of each spreader with two holes into the brackets on
the mast, with the thin edge facing aft on the mast (toward the sail
track). Line up the holes, reinstall the two clevis pins, and reattach
the cotter rings. Remove the clevis pins in the outboard end of each
spreader and pull out the small clip. After locating the port upper
shroud, slide the clip onto it and back into the port spreader; then
reinsert the clevis pin. Repeat for the starboard upper/spreader.
Double check there is no rigging running between the upper ends of
the shrouds and the spreaders. For extra security, tape around the
spreaders to keep the cotter rings from working loose.
Step mast
Check there are no overhead wires in the area and make sure all hal-
yards are secured so they won’t be lost. Two people are recommend-
ed to step the mast. The taller person should place the mast heel
against a solid object, lift the top end, and walk toward the heel, rais-
ing it hand over hand until the mast stands vertical. Rotate the mast
until the track faces toward the stern of the boat, and keep your
hands a good distance apart while lifting the mast over the step.
Align the mast heel so that the groove fits over the middle pin in the
deck fitting. Once the mast heel is in the step, the second person
should attach the shroud on the opposite side of the boat by remov-
ing the bottom clevis pin and reassembling it through the chain plate
on the rail. Attach the second shroud the same way; then lean the
mast forward against the shrouds and tie off the headstay If you will
be using a bowline, attach the headstay to the clevis pin just aft of
the shackle and tie the bowline into the shackle. Otherwise, tie the
headstay directly to the shackle. Tighten it just enough so the mast
will not fall over; the jib halyard will tension the rig for sailing.
Recommended shroud position:Count up the following number
of holes from the bottom of the adjuster in the back row: 4 for light
air, 2 for medium air, 0 for heavy air (bottom hole).

Rig boom
Lay the boom on the deck so that the block closest to the end of the
boom is even with the traveler eye straps and the other end points
toward the bow. Remove the fast pin from the gooseneck and line
up the holes in the forward end of the boom with the gooseneck
holes, then reinsert the pin. Untape the outhaul tail from the boom
if you haven’t already done so.
Mainsheet and vang
The Vanguard 15 mainsheet has a bridle spliced into one end that
fastens to the stern deck. Locate the thicker end and pass it forward
through the block on the end of the boom, through the black strap,
through the forward block, then down through the ratchet block in
the cockpit in the direction of the ratchet. Tie a stopper knot in the
bitter end. The shockcord attached to the rudder gudgeons keeps
the mainsheet bridle from fouling. Tie a tight bowline in each end of
the shockcord and pass the thinner ends of the sheet through the
bowlines; then attach the ends of the sheet to the two eyestraps on
the stern deck, keeping their length fairly even. Locate the vang
(attached to the mast) and shackle the loose block to the bail on the
underside of the boom. Make sure the line is uncleated and will run
free. Adjust bridle ends until the mainsheet splice is on centerline;
this will improve performance in light air. Remove twists in the bri-
dle often while sailing.
Mainsail
After checking there are no sharp objects in the area, unroll the
mainsail near the boat and install the top batten, thin end first.
Secure the velcro over the end. Locate the clew slug and slide it into
the aft end of the boom track. Fasten the tack to the inboard end of
the boom by removing the attached fast pin and reinstalling it
through the grommet. Check there are no twists in the foot (lower
edge).  
Outhaul
Tie a stopper knot in one end of the outhaul. Pass the other end
through the eyestrap on the port outboard end of the boom,
through the clew of the sail from port to starboard, back through
the block on the end of the boom, and forward to the cleat. Tie a
stopper knot in the end to keep it from unrigging itself.

Sail Controls
Jib
The jib halyard replaces the headstay when the jib is up, allowing for
a wide adjustment of mast rake. The headstay will fall slack when the
jib halyard is properly tensioned. Remove the clevis pin just aft of the
headstay, line up the jib tack between the holes, and reinsert the cle-
vis pin. Locate the jib sheets (one line, in the line bag) and find their
halfway point; this is where they will attach to the sail. Feed the mid-
point through the clew grommet as a loop and pass both tails
through this loop, so that when tightened, the sheet is securely
attached to the sail. Lead the nearest sheet back to the fairlead on
the near side of the boat, and lead the other sheet in front of the
mast and back to the opposite fairlead. Tie a stopper knot in the ends
to prevent them from pulling out when you raise the sail. Locate the
jib halyard shackle and attach it to the head of the jib. Make sure the
jib sheets will run free and pull up the halyard. When the sail is most
of the way up, you will get to a loop at the end of the wire; hook the
purchase located on the port side of the mast into this loop and pull
up on the purchase. Tie off the end of the purchase to the cleat, and
coil the halyard into the line bag. To keep the headstay from inter-
fering with the jib, take up the slack in the wire at the bottom with
a piece of shockcord (not provided).
Raising the mainsail
Locate the aft end of the main halyard and attach it to the head of
the mainsail. The smaller the knot, the closer to the top of the mast
the sail will be. Make sure the mainsheet will run free and pull up the
sail, feeding it into the sail track. Once the sail is near the masthead,
you will find a stainless ring tied into the line. Pass a loop of halyard
through the ring and down under the cleat, and use this additional
purchase to pull the main up to full hoist. Cleat off the halyard, and
coil the tail into the line bag. The cunningham is attached to the port
side of the mast. Pass the end up through the grommet in the luff of
the mainsail and back down to the clam cleat on the starboard side
of the mast. Tie a stopper knot in the bitter end to prevent it from
unrigging itself.
Before launching
Attach the rudder to the gudgeons as shown, kicking up the rudder
if necessary. Make sure the rudder bolt is tight enough so the blade
will remain kicked up. If the rudder stop does not prevent the rudder
from lifting off the boat, bend the stop out so that it fits as shown.
Pass the tiller between the mainsheet bridles and slide it into the rud-
der head. Wrap the rudder down haul loosely around the cleat; this
line will get tightened once the rudder is all the way down. The
shockcord reduces damage if the rudder hits something while sailing.

Launching
Launching
Daggerboard:With the boat in shallow water or secured to a dock,
slide the daggerboard into the daggerboard trunk as much as water
depth will allow. The thin edge should be aft and the handle up.
Stretch the shockcord around the aft edge with the plastic tubing
against the edge of the board; this helps keep the board at a desired
height.  
Rudder:Push the rudder blade down as much as water depth will
allow. Once it is all the way down, tighten the downhaul line and
secure it to the cleat.
Unrigging
As you approach shallow water when you come in from sailing, pull
up the daggerboard halfway. Untie the rudder downhaul and pop up
the rudder. After you are secured to the dock or standing in shallow
water, pull the daggerboard out of its slot and lay it down in the bot-
tom of the boat. Make sure your mainsheet will run free, and release
the vang. To remove the rudder, depress the stop and pull it off.
Once the boat is on land, make sure the headstay is still tied off to
the bow shackle before dropping the jib. You can leave the boat
rigged unless it is traveling; just make sure both halyards are secured.
Remove the boom and roll it up with the mainsail. When unstepping
the rig, leave the shroud adjusters attached to the shrouds to prevent
damaging them while cartopping.
Sail care tips
All gear should be rinsed, if sailing
in salt water, and the sail should be
allowed to dry before it is rolled up.
Removing the battens from the
pockets between uses will increase
the life of the elastic that holds
them in. Make sure the window is
not creased when you fold the sail.
