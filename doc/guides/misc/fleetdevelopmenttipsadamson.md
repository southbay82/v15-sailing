Fleet Development Tips
Before embarking on an effort to develop a fleet in your area, you need to ask two
questions: (1) Is there a void (no strong double-handed dinghy fleet to compete against) in
your area’s double-handed dinghy scene? And (2) are there a suitable number of people
interested in that type of sailing to make it worthwhile? These are two very good questions
to answer prior to spending money on a boat and a lot of time (which is the real key) trying
to make a fleet successful. Luckily (at least for people interested in Vanguard 15 sailing),
for most of us the answer is yes. Here are a few key points to successful fleet
development
• Seeding the Fleet:
If you have no boats or very few boats in your area, it’s time to start talking-up the
concept. It’s important to seed a new fleet with about 8 to 10 boats to really have a good
chance of long-term success. Call your sailing buddies and other experienced sailors in
the area that might enjoy a new challenge. Post messages on the bulletin boards of area
Yacht Clubs or in Sailing Associations. Talk it up at local dinghy or keelboat regattas.
You’ll be surprised how many interested people are out there. They just won’t move
without a group effort.
• A Place to Call Home:
A central location with a good sailing venue goes a long way in helping a fleet establish
itself and grow. In general, most people would rather leave their boats at a sailing site for
quick access and low transportation hassle. By negotiating a deal with a local Yacht Club,
community sailing center, or other type of water-access entity early on, you can help solve
the storage and transportation problems some fleet members would experience and in
doing so help to eliminate another barrier to joining the fleet.
• Fleet Hierarchy—Spreading the Load:
Establishing a fleet hierarchy early on goes a long way in helping a fleet develop as
quickly as possible. Just like a well-run business or nonprofit organization, a well-
organized fleet structure helps distribute responsibilities and keeps things running
smoothly. Identify areas such as regatta organization, fleet funding, social activities, and
recruiting prospects, and assign people to make sure each is proactively taken care of.
Make sure no one individual is saddled with an undue load, or the motivation factor will
slip pretty quickly. The key is to distribute the load fairly and hold each party accountable
for timely results (within reason of course).
• Communication is the Key:
I hate to sound like a broken record, but the web has definitely made it a lot easier to
communicate. Every fleet should have a web site set up that details its schedule, fleet
contacts, helpful information, regatta information, and so on. This can be used as a central
information resource, accessible by all, and will save everyone a lot of time in the long run.
A list server is another great tool that facilitates communication and the spread of
information. Set these tools up early and use them often.

• Regatta Schedule—Mix It Up:
The Vanguard 15 is fun, versatile, and easy to transport. Keep these things in mind when
you set up your regatta schedule. Varying the racing format is an easy way to keep things
interesting for the fleet. Fleet racing, team racing, long-course racing, and short-course
racing are just a few options you have when putting a schedule together. Selecting
different venues is another great way to mix up the schedule. While it is great to have a
central location for the majority of events, travelling to different venues definitely adds
some spice. Last but not least, try doing something completely different like camping
regattas or mixed sport events. Be creative!
Everyone is a Recruiter:
Fleet development is an ongoing process that really never ends. A fleet that stops
proactively trying to grow will quickly stagnate and begin to shrink. Once the shrinking
starts, it is very hard to stop. To make sure that the fleet continues to grow, everyone in
the fleet should act as a recruiter. Make it a fleet policy that you give up your boat to a
prospect if you can’t sail it in an event. Hold A/B division prospect regattas where every
owner brings someone new to sail opposite them. Above all, never be satisfied with the
status quo, it will change before you know it.—Nick Adamson, Fleet 53
